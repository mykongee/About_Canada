H--Dining etiquette
Dining etiquette in Canada is very easygoing across the country. In Quebec however, things may be a bit more formal.
Provinces and territories (excluding Quebec)
-fork in left hand; knife in right hand
-no elbows on the table
-Apply pressure to knife and fork using index finger
-If the food is easier to eat with hand then do so
-Do not start to eat until everyone and the host is ready
-meals are served in different courses (Usually one appetizer, one salad, one main dish and one dessert)
-Try to eat all the food on your plate
Quebec
-wine is usually served with a meal
-If you are invited to drink at a bar, it is expected that each person is to pay for a round.
-Refer to a waiter as ‘Monsieur’ and a waitress as ‘Madamoiselle’
Tipping
-It is courtesy to tip about 15-20% of the total bill. Less than 15% is used for tipping poor service. If the service is outstanding, it is common to tip 25%.
-In Quebec, waiters are automatically taxed 8% of their pay every day. As such, it costs the waiter money to serve food.
-it is also respectful for tipping other services such as taxi service, hairdressers as well as hotel service.
-Tipping is optional but highly recommended. Servers and general labourers are not paid well in Canada and as such, they will rely on tipping as part of their income.
Street safety and etiquette
-Generally, it is illegal for pedestrians to cross the road if there is no crosswalk. Pedestrians must yield to vehicles. Bylaws may differ depending on municipalities.
-In Canada it is common to walk on the right side of sidewalks and staircases.
-Vehicles in Canada drive on the right side of the road.
-Be sure to follow bylaws which may vary between municipalities.
Communication
-introduce yourself by saying your name and then shaking hands with a firm grip
-don’t talk loudly as that is disrespectful
-maintain eye contact but do not stare too long
